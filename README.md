# Face and characteristics recognition with speech support
Current project describes the development of software tool to be used by blind people to help them understand visual information by presenting it in audio format. An input image is analysed to detect any existing faces in it and for each face classify de gender and emotion of the person. The tool also allows to store in the system the identity of the person detected so it can be used later in the analysis stage and output this information also in audio format. Multiple languages are supported and to ease the interaction with the user the system as an audio menu and captures spoken commands. On the development of the tool AI techniques including neural networks and text to voice and voice to text tools have been used.
